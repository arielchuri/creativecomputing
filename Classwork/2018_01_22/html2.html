            Today we woke up to a <a href="html.html">revolution</a> of snow,<br>  
            its white flag waving over everything,<br>
            the landscape vanished,<br>
            not a single mouse to punctuate the blankness,   <br>
            and beyond these windows<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            the <em>government</em> buildings smothered,<br>
            schools and libraries buried, the post office lost   <br>
            under the noiseless drift,<br>
            the paths of trains softly blocked,<br>
            the world fallen under this falling.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In a while, I will put on some boots<br>
            and step out like someone walking in water,   <br>
            and the dog will <strong>porpoise</strong> through the drifts,   <br>
            and I will shake a laden branch<br>
            sending a cold shower down on us both.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            But for now I am a willing prisoner in this house,   <br>
            a sympathizer with the anarchic cause of snow.   <br>
            I will make a pot of tea<br>
            and listen to the plastic radio on the counter,   <br>
            as glad as anyone to hear the news<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            that the Kiddie Corner School is closed,   <br>
            the Ding-Dong School, closed.<br>
            the All Aboard Children’s School, closed,   <br>
            the Hi-Ho Nursery School, closed,<br>
            along with—some will be delighted to hear—<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            the Toadstool School, the Little School,<br>
            Little Sparrows Nursery School,<br>
            Little Stars Pre-School, Peas-and-Carrots Day School   <br>
            the Tom Thumb Child Center, all closed,<br>
            and—clap your hands—the Peanuts Play School.<br>
            <p>
            </p>
            So this is where the children hide all day,<br>
            These are the nests where they letter and draw,   <br>
            where they put on their bright miniature jackets,   <br>
            all darting and climbing and sliding,<br>
            all but the few girls whispering by the fence.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And now I am listening hard<br>
            in the grandiose silence of the snow,<br>
            trying to hear what those three girls are plotting,   <br>
            what riot is afoot,<br>
            which small queen is about to be brought down.<br>
